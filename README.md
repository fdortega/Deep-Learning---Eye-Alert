## A Deep Learning Approach for the Reduction of Sleep Related Accidents

A study revealed that Texas led the country in sleep-related fatalities in 2016. It was not even close; Texas recorded 159 sleep related fatalities and Alabama came in second with 43. A separate poll conducted by Goshen Health revealed that 60% of Americans have driven while feeling extremely sleepy while 37% admit to falling completely asleep behind the wheel. Tired drivers often fail to recognize when they are about to fall asleep.

This project will incorporate deep learning, convolutional neural network modeling, and computer vision to detect sleepy drivers and alert them of when it is time to pull over and take a nap. The end goal is to make all roads safer for everyone.
